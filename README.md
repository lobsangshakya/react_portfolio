# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio showcasing my work as a developer.

Built with React, Vite, and TypeScript.

## Running Locally

1. Make sure Node.js is installed
2. Open terminal and navigate to this directory
3. Run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Deploying

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with your production-ready site.
